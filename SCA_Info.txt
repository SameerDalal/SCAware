Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. Without treatment sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death.
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is the consequence of SCA.
Emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care.

Symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include:
Sudden collapse
No pulse
No breathing
Loss of consciousness

Sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest like fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heartbeat called palpitations.
But sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning.

Portable automated external defibrillators, called AEDs, are available in many public places.

Complications
When sudden cardiac arrest occurs, less blood flows to the brain. If the heart rhythm isn't rapidly restored, complications may include brain damage and death.
